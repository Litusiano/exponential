## About Litus Mele
I am Litus, a 19-year-old born in Sabadell, Barcelona. My friends describe me as competitive yet friendly. Some of my hobbies are football, going to live music events, and fixing/building random things (my latest projects have been buying and tuning a dumbphone, fixing and digitalizing a turntable, and the next one will be building a watch with a Japanese NH35 movement!).

I am a second-year Mathematics and Data Science student at CFIS-UPC. I am also working as a Research Assistant in Economics at IESE Business School under the supervision of MIT PhD Marc de la Barrera. Last summer I was a Teaching Assistant at [Addiscoder]([url](https://www.addiscoder.com)), a non-profit organisation founded by UC Berkeley Professor Jelani Nelson that teaches Python and algorithms to the best ethiopian high-schoolers, with the goal of sending them to US universities some of the alumni have already graduated from Harvard or MIT, it's the ethiopian exponential `;)`

Challenges motivate me, I want to work on things that challenge me and that can help others. Coding was the first "serious" challenge I have found in my life, and took it pretty seriously starting in 2020, I competed in Olympiads in Informatics and become top 10 in Spain+Latam, and top 2 in my region (behind the historical best competitive programmer in Spain).

### Main Achievements

- **CFIS-UPC**: Pursuing a Double BSc in Math and Data Science, one of the 37 admited to the excellence program.
- **IESE Business School** Working as a Research Assistant solving and optimizing economic models under the supervision of MIT PhD Marc de la Barrera. 
- **Addiscoder 2025**: Spend the summer working with UC Berkeley, Stanford and Harvard MSc and PhD candidates teaching programming and mentoring 123 top ethiopian students. They are now applying to US Schools, hope to see good results!
- **Ibero-American Olympiad in Informatics 2024**: Being 1 of the 9 Spanish representantives I was the top 10 (gold medal) out of 160+ participants representing the best competitive programmers of 14 countries.
- **HackUPC 2023 -- Optiver Challenge**: Got an honorable mention in a hackathon of 600+ college participants, when being the only highschool team: we developed a market-making algorithm that provided profit and liquidity to the market by using arbitrage and hedging.
- **Leagues of Code**: One of 15 scholarships awarded to be weekly taught and mentored by a global top 20 competitive programmer (ICPC Gold, IMO Gold, LGM on Codeforces) and an IOI Gold.

## Most-Prideful Builds
| Project | Role & Stack | Why it matters |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
|**AddisCoder**	|  Teaching Assistant |  Introduced 123 Ethiopian kids to programming & unlocked opportunities: they are applying to US universities thanks to the program (one already admitted at Harvard). |
|**IESE Business School** | Research Assistant | Made complex Economical Models 10x Faster & soon posting the paper I helped on. |
| **Olympiads in Informatics** | Participant (and sometimes winner \;) ) | Solved 1300+ algorithmic problems, 1000+ hours learning and became top 6 competitive programmer in Spain | 
| **Spanish Olympiad in Informatics** | Advanced Algorithms Teacher | Weekly teaching advanced algorithms and mentoring 8 out of the top 30 Spanish high school programmers | 
| **Restoring and virtualizing music equipment** | Solo-dev • Raspberry Pi • DYI | Restored a 70’ turntable and speakers and added Airplay and Bluetooth via RPi. |

Other builds: home NAS,  market making bot (HackUPC 2023).

## How I Work

- **Gets me Pumped** : hard challenges • being the worst in a team •  competition • people believing on me 
- **Disappoints me**: not creative challenges • things done without effort • bad working environment
- **Strengths**: obsessive • love learning • organized • friendly
- **Known behaviours / comms style**: direct • prefer call over message • transparent • fast response

### Some personal stuff
- Love doing things, I can not be chill at home
- On Thursday nights, I play football in a "Sunday league" as a midfielder 
- Listener of spanish "emergent" artists no one knows, I usually go to concerts every one or two weeks in some seasons.
- Hate phones, [this](https://img.pccomponentes.com/articles/35/356934/4856-doro-7030-negro-libre-52e88e78-1351-48e3-ba52-3a30f97b34d6.jpg) is my day to day phone and [this](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ipod/images/d/de/Shuffleipod.jpg/revision/latest/thumbnail/width/360/height/450?cb=20120419181833) my day to day warrior
- Tend to organize tons of meetings with my friends to keep ourselfs updated and distracted!

### My vision
Over the next five years, I will build a network to connect all the historic Olympic medalists in Spain (top 12 programmers each year), and I will keep learning by building and interning at companies. Before graduating, I plan to do my final thesis at a top US university and then start building with some colleagues. The US fits this plan as it has the fast pace and creative environment making it the ideal place to build.
