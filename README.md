## About Litus Mele
I am Litus, a 19 year old born in Sabadell, Barcelona. My friends describe me as competitive and friendly. My real passions are football, going to live music events and fixing/building random things (last projects have been buying (and tuning) a dumbphone, fixing and digitalizing a turntable equipment and next one will be building a watch!)

I am a second-year Mathematics and Data Science student at CFIS-UPC. I am also working as a Research Assistant in Economics at IESE Business School under the supervision of MIT PhD Marc de la Barrera. Past summer I was a Teaching Assistant at Addiscoder, a non-profit organisation that teaches python and algorithms ot the best ethiopian high-schoolers, with the goal of sending them to US universities and that they come back to develop their country, it's the ethiopian exponential ;)

Challenges motivate me, and that's my ambition, work something that challenges me and that can help others. Coding was the first "serious" challenge I have found in my life, and took it pretty seriously starting in 2020, I competed in Olympiads in Informatics and become top 10 in Spain+Latam, and top 2 in my region (behind the historical best competitive programmer in Spain).

### Main Achievements

- **CFIS-UPC** Doing a Double BSc in Math and Data Science, one of the 37 admited to the excellence program.
- **Addiscoder 2025** Spend the summer working with US MSc and PhD target universities candidates teaching programming and mentoring 123 top ethiopian students
