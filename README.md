## About Litus Mele
I am Litus, a 19 year old born in Sabadell, Barcelona. My friends describe me as competitive and friendly. My real passions are football, going to live music events and fixing/building random things (last projects have been buying (and tuning) a dumbphone, fixing and digitalizing a turntable equipment and next one will be building a watch!)

I am a second-year Mathematics and Data Science student at CFIS-UPC. I am also working as a Research Assistant in Economics at IESE Business School under the supervision of MIT PhD Marc de la Barrera. Past summer I was a Teaching Assistant at Addiscoder, a non-profit organisation that teaches python and algorithms ot the best ethiopian high-schoolers, with the goal of sending them to US universities and that they come back to develop their country, it's the ethiopian exponential ;)

Challenges motivate me, and that's my ambition, work something that challenges me and that can help others. Coding was the first "serious" challenge I have found in my life, and took it pretty seriously starting in 2020, I competed in Olympiads in Informatics and become top 10 in Spain+Latam, and top 2 in my region (behind the historical best competitive programmer in Spain).

### Main Achievements

- **CFIS-UPC**: Doing a Double BSc in Math and Data Science, one of the 37 admited to the excellence program.
- **Addiscoder 2025**: Spend the summer working with UC Berkeley, Stanford and Harvard MSc and PhD candidates teaching programming and mentoring 123 top ethiopian students they are now applying to US Schools, hope to see good results!
- **Ibero-American Olympiad in Informatics 2024**: Being 1 of the 9 Spanish representantives I was the top 10 (gold medal) out of 160+ participants representing the best competitive programmers of 14 countries.
- **HackUPC 2023 -- Optiver Challenge**: Got an honorable mention in a hackathon of 600+ college participants, when being the only highschool team: we developed a market-making algorithm that provided profit and liquidity to the market by using arbitrage and hedging.
